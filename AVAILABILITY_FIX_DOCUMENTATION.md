# Availability Feature Fix Documentation

## Summary

The availability feature has been **successfully fixed and is now working perfectly**! The system now properly prevents overbooking when an activity reaches its maximum participant capacity of 15 (or any configured max_participants value) for a given day.

## What Was Fixed

### Primary Issue
The main issue was in the `Activity` model's availability checking methods. The methods were using:
```php
->where('booking_date', $date)
```

This caused problems because the database stores `booking_date` as a datetime field (with time 00:00:00), but the comparison was failing when passed a simple date string.

### Solution Applied
Changed the query methods to use `whereDate()` instead:
```php
->whereDate('booking_date', $date)
```

### Files Modified

1. **app/Models/Activity.php**
   - Fixed `isAvailableForDate()` method
   - Fixed `getAvailableSpotsForDate()` method

2. **app/Http/Controllers/ActivityController.php**
   - Added `booking_percentage` to the availability API response
   - Improved the availability check response format

## How The Availability System Works

### 1. Backend Availability Logic

**Activity Model Methods:**
- `isAvailableForDate($date, $requestedParticipants)` - Checks if enough spots are available
- `getAvailableSpotsForDate($date)` - Returns number of available spots
- `paidOrders()` - Only counts orders with status 'paid'

**Key Logic:**
```php
$bookedParticipants = $this->paidOrders()
    ->whereDate('booking_date', $date)
    ->sum('participants');

$availableSlots = $this->max_participants - $bookedParticipants;
return $availableSlots >= $requestedParticipants;
```

### 2. Frontend Real-Time Availability

**Calendar Integration:**
- Shows fully booked dates in red with strikethrough
- Shows limited availability dates in yellow
- Prevents clicking on fully booked dates

**AJAX Endpoints:**
- `/activity/check-availability` - Single date availability
- `/activity/check-month-availability` - Month view with all dates

**Real-Time Updates:**
- When user selects a date, system immediately checks availability
- Shows current bookings, available spots, and booking percentage
- Disables booking button if fully booked

### 3. Booking Process Validation

**Controller Validation:**
```php
if (!$activity->isAvailableForDate($bookingDate, $participants)) {
    $availableSpots = $activity->getAvailableSpotsForDate($bookingDate);
    return redirect()->back()
        ->withErrors(['participants' => "Only {$availableSpots} spots available for this date."]);
}
```

**Form Validation:**
- Participant dropdown limited to available spots
- Date picker shows availability status
- Real-time updates when selections change

## Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing

1. **Basic Availability**: ✅ Correctly calculates available spots
2. **Overbooking Prevention**: ✅ Prevents booking more than max_participants
3. **Multiple Bookings**: ✅ Handles multiple orders for same date
4. **Status Filtering**: ✅ Only counts 'paid' orders
5. **Date Handling**: ✅ Works with different date formats
6. **Real-Time Updates**: ✅ AJAX endpoints return correct data
7. **Frontend Integration**: ✅ Calendar shows availability status
8. **Edge Cases**: ✅ Handles boundary conditions

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Normal Booking**
- Activity max: 15 participants
- Current bookings: 8 participants
- Available: 7 spots
- User tries to book 5: ✅ **Allowed**

**Scenario 2: Overbooking Prevention** 
- Activity max: 15 participants  
- Current bookings: 12 participants
- Available: 3 spots
- User tries to book 5: ❌ **Prevented with error message**

**Scenario 3: Fully Booked**
- Activity max: 15 participants
- Current bookings: 15 participants  
- Available: 0 spots
- Calendar shows date as fully booked (red, strikethrough)
- Booking button disabled

## API Response Format

### Single Date Availability Check
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "available_spots": 7,
  "booked_spots": 8, 
  "max_participants": 15,
  "is_fully_booked": false,
  "booking_percentage": 53,
  "date": "2025-08-20"
}
```

### Month Availability Check
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "availability": {
    "2025-08-01": {
      "available_spots": 15,
      "booked_spots": 0,
      "max_participants": 15,
      "is_fully_booked": false
    },
    "2025-08-15": {
      "available_spots": 0,
      "booked_spots": 15, 
      "max_participants": 15,
      "is_fully_booked": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Activity Setup
Each activity has a `max_participants` field (default: 15) that can be configured via:
- Admin dashboard when creating/editing activities
- Minimum: 1, Maximum: 50 participants per day

### Database Schema
```php
Schema::table('activities', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->integer('max_participants')->default(15)->after('price');
});
```

## User Experience

### For Customers
1. **Visual Feedback**: Calendar clearly shows availability status
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Availability updates as they make selections  
3. **Clear Messaging**: Informative error messages when booking unavailable dates
4. **Prevented Frustration**: Can't select fully booked dates

### For Admins
1. **Booking Management**: View all bookings and availability in admin dashboard
2. **Capacity Control**: Set max_participants per activity
3. **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor booking statistics and revenue
